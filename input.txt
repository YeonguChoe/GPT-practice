KPop Demon Hunters is a 2025 American animated musical urban fantasy film. It was directed by Maggie Kang and Chris Appelhans, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Danya Jimenez and Hannah McMechan.

The film was produced by Sony Pictures Animation for Netflix.
The film features the voices of Arden Cho, Ahn Hyo-seop, May Hong, Ji-young Yoo, Yunjin Kim, Daniel Dae Kim, Ken Jeong, and Lee Byung-hun.
It tells the story of a K-pop girl group called Huntr/x,[a] who secretly work as demon hunters.
They face off against a rival boy band, the Saja Boys, whose members are secretly demons.
Kang was inspired to create the story by her Korean heritage. She combined elements of mythology, demon stories, and K-pop to make a film that is both visually unique and culturally meaningful.
By March 2021, the project was officially in production at Sony Pictures Animation, with the full creative team on board.
The animation was done by Sony Pictures Imageworks, and the visual style was influenced by concert lighting, photography, music videos, anime, and Korean dramas.

Its sing-along theatrical release was the widest ever for a Netflix film and the first to top the U.S. box office, surpassing Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery (2022).
The soundtrack also achieved major success, earning Platinum certification from the RIAA in October 2025 and becoming the first film soundtrack to have four songs in the Billboard Hot 100 top ten.
